# Chicago-Crime-Prediction
ML analysis studing the Chicago Crime Dataset

# Purpose of study
The present final master project answers the necessity of criminal control in the city of Chicago, with the intention of achieving a safer and fairer city, and the help of data processing provided by Big Data techniques. The solution given is trying to implement a Machine Learning model that provides a crime prediction, as tight as possible, for the following years.

# Where it comes from?
The data used for the implementation of the Project has been the Chicago police records, which are shared as public information trough an API. This information is verified by reliable USA agencies. Therefore, no confidentiality agreement has been required.

# Main goal of the prohect
In order to achieve the goal, a series of algorithms focused on supervised learning models which depend on a target variable have been used. The variable selected for its characteristics, is the district where the crimes are committed. The main goal is anticipating events or actions carried out in a specific area.
